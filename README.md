<h2> OBJECTIVE </H2>
<UL>
  <LI> Make a expression detection which shows numbers when human is angry number should be in negative and increases according to anger	when he is happy mood then number should be positive input video stream of human and output should be labeled number according to their mood (+ve number = good mood -ve number =bad) </LI>

<h2> What does Expression detection mean? </H2>
<UL>
  <li> Expression detection is a technique used in software that allows a program to "read" the expression on a human face using advanced image processing. Companies have been experimenting with combining sophisticated algorithms with image processing techniques that have emerged in the past ten years to understand more about what an image or a video of a person's face tells us about how he/she is feeling and not just that but also showing the probabilities of mixed emotions a face could has. <li/>
